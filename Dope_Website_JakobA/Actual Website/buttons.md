For the styling of the Buttons, I found a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/html5/comments/u7o29l/how_to_create_a_button_that_works_as_a_link_to) by user u/rapidtab. The reply by user u/ole1993 gave an example of how to style buttons, with which i played around and adjusted it a bit to my liking.
