    <h1>European Studies</h1>

    <h2>What is European Studies</h2>
    <p>
      European Studies focuses on the political, cultural, and historical aspects of Europe and the European Union.
      The different courses and modules introduce multiple topic areas relevant to the study, such as EU Borders,
      EU Identity, EU Institutions, and current issues.

    <h2>Why did I choose this Study Course?</h2>

        <div class="content">
          <p>In German high schools, you have to choose two intensive courses that make up the largest share of your education
      and grading. I chose Social Sciences and English as they represent my interests and skills the best. Within social
      sciences, my favourite topics were always those regarding international politics. Political bodies like the UN
      and the EU were always of the highest interest to me, which is why I decided to focus my further studies on this
      area. For my Bachelor's, I studied International Relations and wrote my thesis on the voting behaviour of certain
      states in the EU Council. To further intensify my skills and knowledge in this field, I decided to continue by
      doing a Master's degree in European Studies afterwards.</p>

          <p>    While I do not have a clear vision of what I want to do after finishing my Master's, I definitely want to stay in
      the realm of European Politics. Right now, my favourite thing to do is Policy Analysis and the handling and
      creation of quantitative data. Unfortunately, I also do not have the most work experience yet, so I have not really
      figured out yet, what I want/do not want for my professional career. </p>

    <h2>Current Topics in the Field of European Studies</h2>
    <p>
      My personal fields of interest are populism, democratic backsliding and migration. Luckily for me, I will not be running out 
      of issues to research any time soon. All over Europe, populists are growing stronger and democracies are under attack. 
      Most recently, I was looking into migration and its effect on security and safety, as this is one of the topics often used 
      by populists to support anti-migration sentiments. A great study was published earlier in 2025 from a German research 
      institute called ifo

      that both explored a bunch of interesting research and context.
